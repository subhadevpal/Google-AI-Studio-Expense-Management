# This file configures the deployment of your React application on Render.
# It assumes you have a package.json file with a "build" script
# that compiles your TypeScript/React code into static HTML, CSS, and JS files.

services:
  - type: staticSite
    # A unique name for your static site
    name: p2p-expense-ledger
    
    # The environment for the service. 'static' is appropriate for frontend apps.
    env: static
    
    # The command Render will run to build your site.
    # This typically installs dependencies and then runs your build script.
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    
    # The directory where your built static files are located after the build command runs.
    # Common directories are 'dist' (for Vite) or 'build' (for Create React App).

    # This ensures that all navigation requests are handled by your index.html,
    # allowing client-side routing (like React Router) to work correctly.
